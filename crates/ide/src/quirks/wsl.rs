//! WSL path conversion.
//!
//! `JetBrains` on Windows often reports workspace paths as
//! `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\user\project`, while the shell inside WSL sees
//! `/home/user/project`. This module will translate between them so
//! `IdeSelection::file_path` remains useful regardless of where the
//! crab process is running.
//!
//! Reference: `claude-code-best/src/utils/idePathConversion.ts`

/// Translate an IDE-reported path into the current shell's namespace.
///
/// For R1 this is the identity function; R3 will add `\\wsl$\…`
/// translation, `C:\` ↔ `/mnt/c/` mapping, and path canonicalization.
