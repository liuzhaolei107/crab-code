//! Integration tests for TUI cell snapshot baselines.
//!
//! Each fixture builds a preset `App`-cell state, renders it into a
//! fixed-size buffer, and compares against `tests/snaps/<name>.snap`.
//!
//! First run: snap file does not exist -> baseline is written and the
//! test passes.
//! Subsequent runs: any rendering difference fails with a printed diff.
//!
//! Updating a baseline: delete the corresponding `.snap` file and rerun
//! (only after verifying the rendering change is intentional).
//!
//! Layout note: fixture sources live in `tests/snapshots/` so they do
//! not pollute the top-level `tests/` directory. Cargo only treats
//! top-level `tests/*.rs` files as separate test binaries; sub-directory
//! files are silent. We use `#[path = "..."]` attributes to point the
//! `mod` declarations at the sub-directory.
