# Changelog

All notable changes to Crab Code are listed here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The TUI's welcome panel parses the entries under the **most recent version**
and lists its bullets under "What's new". Keep bullets short (≤ 80 chars) and
imperative.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Welcome panel shown at startup on version change or new project
- `reasoning_content` parsing for DeepSeek-reasoner / DeepSeek-R1
- Collapsed display for parallel read-only tool runs (Read / Grep / Glob)
- `CRAB_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL` env var to opt-in PowerShell tool on Windows

### Changed
- Project instructions file renamed from `CRAB.md` to `AGENTS.md`
  (aligns with the cross-tool AGENTS.md standard used by Codex and others)
- Bash tool now strictly requires POSIX shell (bash/zsh); no cmd.exe fallback
- Read-only tool classification now queried from `Tool::is_read_only()` trait
  rather than a hardcoded TUI list
- System prompt Shell line no longer reports `COMSPEC` on Windows
- Environment variables consolidated under the `CRAB_` prefix
  (was `CRAB_CODE_*` for new variables)
- Header logo redesigned and moved to `crates/tui/assets/header-logo.txt`

### Removed
- Hardcoded read-only tool list in TUI layer
- 3-step onboarding modal overlay; its guidance is now implicit — the welcome
  cell's project hint plus the permanent "? for shortcuts" bottom bar cover
  the same ground without interrupting the user
- `has_completed_onboarding` field from `GlobalState` (no longer needed)
- "First time? Press /help" hint from the welcome cell (duplicated the
  permanent bottom bar)
